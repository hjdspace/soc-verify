"""sweep_handshakes — whole-design handshake anomaly sweep (P1).

Reframed per the MCP/LLM boundary: this is NOT a "localize the bug" verdict tool.
It is an M-way fan-out **context reducer**. The LLM physically cannot open the
waveform, and on a design with many near-identical handshake interfaces it would
otherwise pay N round-trips of suggest -> read bundle -> inspect, and carry N
result payloads in context, just to find which interface misbehaves. This
collapses that into one call that returns a **comparative fact table**: every
discovered valid/ready interface with its cycle-by-cycle handshake facts, ordered
by a transparent, mechanical sort key.

It draws no causal conclusion. The ordering is a convenience; every raw fact is
exposed so the LLM ranks and overrides. ``flags`` are factual observations
(e.g. the window ended mid-stall), never verdicts ("deadlock").

Built entirely from the two existing primitives:
  - ``suggest_handshakes`` — discovers valid/ready/clock/payload bundles by name
  - ``inspect_handshake`` — per-interface cycle classification (incl. the
    ``ended_in_stall`` deadlock signature)
Reads existing waveforms only — does NOT rerun simulation.
