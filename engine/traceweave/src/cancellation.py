"""Cooperative cancellation for worker-thread tool bodies.

Waveform tool bodies run in worker threads (``server._run_in_wave_thread``)
so a heavy scan cannot starve the asyncio event loop. Python cannot preempt
a running thread, so cancellation is cooperative: the server arms a
``threading.Event`` per call and sets it when the client abandons the request
or a higher-priority query preempts a background scan; long scan loops call
:func:`check_cancelled` at checkpoints and bail out with
:class:`OperationCancelled`.

The event travels via a ``ContextVar`` set inside the worker thread, so
library code (``cycle_query``, ``handshake_sweep``, ``verify_condition``)
needs no signature changes. Outside a worker thread the checkpoint is a
no-op, which keeps every existing synchronous test path unaffected.
