connectivity_backend.py
Backend abstraction for driver / load / path (connectivity) queries.

Three execution shapes are wired: ``StaticConnectivityBackend`` (pure-Python
source-regex, always available), local ``VerdiNpiBackend``, and the optional
LSF-backed NPI wrapper selected by environment policy when a Verdi KDB is
detected. They share one Protocol so MCP tool arguments never branch on
execution placement.

Design intent: backend selection happens at the dispatch site (server.py)
based on probe_verdi_backend status — not inside individual scanners.
The NPI backend normally wraps Static internally and degrades to it on any
per-call failure. Production driver/load/path routing may
instead inject :class:`DeferredConnectivityFallbackBackend` so Source Graph gets
the first fallback opportunity. Legacy Static still returns a structured
``static_backend_no_path_api`` for ``find_path`` because source regex has no
honest path equivalent.
