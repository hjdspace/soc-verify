<h2 align="center">Waveform + log root-cause MCP — stop debugging by hand, use TraceWeave.</h2>

What sets TraceWeave apart: when a Verdi license is available it engages KDB/NPI for accurate cross-hierarchy driver / load / connectivity analysis; without a license it still locates issues via the built-in Static backend, log parsing, and VCD/FSDB waveform reads. It supports driver backtracking, load/fanout lookup, value-at-time queries, cycle-aligned sampling, arbitrary signal-window queries, lightweight X/Z tracing, structural risk scanning, and failure-group diffing — and emits structured next-step debug recommendations for MCP clients.

TraceWeave is a workflow-oriented debug server rather than a loose collection of parsers. It combines:

- An MCP server with session state, workflow gates, and recommended tool ordering
- Path discovery for compile logs, simulation logs, and waveform artifacts
- Compile-log-driven hierarchy building and source-aware driver correlation
- VCD and FSDB waveform backends with signal search
- Failure-centric recommendations, structural risk scanning, and X/Z propagation tracing
- Structured output schemas designed for MCP clients

## When TraceWeave helps most

TraceWeave is not a universal speedup, and it is honest about that. In blind
benchmarking against a capable LLM that only reads source and text logs:

- **When the RTL is readable and the bug is a source-visible logic error**, an
  LLM reading the source is already fast. Here TraceWeave mainly *confirms* the
  hypothesis from the waveform — and `scan_structural_risks` can statically pin
  the offending line. Useful, but not where the moat is.
- **TraceWeave becomes the decisive — sometimes the only — way to localize when
  the answer is not in readable source:**
  - the design is **encrypted/protected IP** or too large to eyeball, so the bug
    cannot be read or grep'd; or
  - the failure is a **timing / handshake / X / connectivity bug with no static
    signature** and an **opaque symptom** (timeout, stall, divergence — no value
    pattern in the log).

  In those cases the clock-sampled waveform facts — cycle-aligned sampling,
  `inspect_handshake`, `suggest_protocol_bundles`, `sweep_handshakes`,
  `reconstruct_transactions`, `verify_window`, `diff_first_divergence`,
  `period`, `trace_x_source`, structural scanning — localize the failing stage
  and time directly, where
  reading source or grepping cannot reach. Reading the source is a strong
  baseline; TraceWeave earns its keep on **opaque symptoms and unreadable or
  large designs.**

## Architecture

## Installation

TraceWeave requires Python `3.11+`.

```bash
pip install mcp pyyaml --user
```

For FSDB support, one of these runtime sources must be available:

- Repo-local runtime: `third_party/verdi_runtime/linux64/libnsys.so` and `libnffr.so`
- External Verdi installation exposed via `VERDI_HOME/share/FsdbReader/linux64`

If neither is available, TraceWeave still works, but FSDB parsing is disabled and the workflow should prefer `.vcd` waveforms.

Enable FSDB support (links the Verdi runtime into the repo and builds
`libfsdb_wrapper.so` in one step):

```bash
# Example only — replace with your site's Verdi install path
export VERDI_HOME=/path/to/verdi
bash scripts/setup_fsdb.sh
```

> **After `git pull`**: `libfsdb_wrapper.so` is built locally, not tracked in
> git. If a pulled update changed `fsdb_wrapper.cpp`, the first FSDB query
> fails with a *"libfsdb_wrapper.so is outdated"* error — rebuild with
> `bash build_wrapper.sh` and reconnect the MCP server. This is deliberately
> fail-loud: an outdated wrapper could silently return misaligned timestamps.
> Rebuilding is also required to activate the optional FSDB transition-group
> optimization used by `sweep_handshakes`.

Verify the runtime and wrapper load correctly. This script does **not**
require `$VERDI_HOME` and is safe to run on any host that already has the
repo-local artefacts:

```bash
bash scripts/verify_fsdb.sh
```

## Client Setup

### Generic MCP Client

Any MCP client that supports stdio transport can connect to this server. The minimum configuration is:

- command: `python3.11`
- args: `["<TRACEWEAVE_HOME>/server.py"]`
- env: provide either repo-local `third_party/verdi_runtime/linux64` or `VERDI_HOME` if FSDB support is required

If the client supports server instructions, it can follow the built-in workflow directly. Otherwise, use the workflow below.

### Claude Code

Environment inheritance depends on how the MCP client itself is launched and on
that client's environment policy. A Codex process launched from a terminal can
inherit variables already exported by that shell; an IDE/GUI launch or another
MCP client may not. For a deterministic Claude Code setup, list every variable
the server needs — tool roots plus the `dlopen` chain (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is the
one most often missed; without it NPI silently falls back to Static and
`trace_signal_path` returns `found: false`).

Add this to `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "TraceWeave": {
      "command": "python3.11",
      "args": ["<TRACEWEAVE_HOME>/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "VERDI_HOME": "<verdi-install>",
        "NOVAS_HOME": "<verdi-install>",
        "VCS_HOME": "<vcs-install>",
        "XLM_ROOT": "<xcelium-install>",
        "CDS_INST_DIR": "<xcelium-install>",
        "SNPSLMD_LICENSE_FILE": "xxxx@s-license.example.com",
        "LM_LICENSE_FILE": "xxxx@s-license-server.example.com",
        "CDS_LICENSE_FILE": "xxxx@c-license.example.com",
        "LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "<library-path>",
        "PATH": "<path>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Verify the connection:

```bash
claude mcp list
# Should show TraceWeave (connected)
```

### Codex

Codex can forward variables inherited by its own process through `env_vars`;
fixed values belong in `env`. For a deterministic EDA setup, configure the
required values explicitly in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.TraceWeave]
command = "python3.11"
args = ["<TRACEWEAVE_HOME>/server.py"]
cwd = "<TRACEWEAVE_HOME>"

[mcp_servers.TraceWeave.env]
VERDI_HOME = "<verdi-install>"
NOVAS_HOME = "<verdi-install>"
VCS_HOME = "<vcs-install>"
XLM_ROOT = "<xcelium-install>"
CDS_INST_DIR = "<xcelium-install>"
SNPSLMD_LICENSE_FILE = "xxxx@s-license.example.com"
LM_LICENSE_FILE = "xxxx@s-license-server.example.com"
CDS_LICENSE_FILE = "xxxx@c-license.example.com"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = "<library-path>"
PATH = "<path>"
```

Verify the connection:

```bash
codex mcp list
# Should show TraceWeave with Status: enabled
```

### LSF-only NPI licenses

Some EDA sites grant Verdi/NPI licenses only to scheduled compute nodes. NPI
execution remains local by default; opt in to LSF at the **TraceWeave MCP
server process** with:

```bash
export TRACEWEAVE_NPI_EXECUTION=lsf
export TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_QUEUE="digital"
```

Here `digital` is only an example; replace it with the user's licensed team
queue. TraceWeave reads only the namespaced `TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_QUEUE`; it does
not create, overwrite, or interpret a site's generic `LSF_QUEUE`. If the site
already exports `LSF_QUEUE`, the user may map that existing value instead:

```bash
export TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_QUEUE="$LSF_QUEUE"
```

For `tcsh`:

```tcsh
setenv TRACEWEAVE_NPI_EXECUTION lsf
setenv TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_QUEUE "digital"
```

Or, only when `LSF_QUEUE` already exists:

```tcsh
setenv TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_QUEUE "$LSF_QUEUE"
```

Putting these values in `.bashrc` / `.tcshrc` works only when the MCP client
inherits that shell environment. A terminal-launched Codex process can do so;
IDE/GUI-launched clients often do not. When the Codex parent process already
contains the exported namespaced queue, the relevant portion of the final
merged configuration should look like this; keep the other EDA variables from
the setup above, then restart or reconnect the MCP server:

```toml
[mcp_servers.TraceWeave]
command = "python3.11"
args = ["<TRACEWEAVE_HOME>/server.py"]
cwd = "<TRACEWEAVE_HOME>"
env_vars = ["TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_QUEUE"]

[mcp_servers.TraceWeave.env]
# Keep the existing EDA environment entries here.
TRACEWEAVE_NPI_EXECUTION = "lsf"
```

Values under `[mcp_servers.TraceWeave.env]` are copied literally by Codex, so do not write
`TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_QUEUE = "$LSF_QUEUE"` there. `env_vars` is the supported
way to forward the value that the user's shell already expanded. If the Codex
parent does not inherit the shell environment, omit the queue from `env_vars`
and put a fixed `TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_QUEUE = "digital"` directly under
`[mcp_servers.TraceWeave.env]` instead.

For Claude Code, merge the following fixed values into the existing TraceWeave
server's `"env"` object (replace `digital` with the user's queue):

```json
{
  "TRACEWEAVE_NPI_EXECUTION": "lsf",
  "TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_QUEUE": "digital"
}
```

JSON values are literal too; do not put `"$LSF_QUEUE"` in this static map.

With this mode enabled, only explicit connectivity operations
(`explain_signal_driver`, `find_signal_loads`, `trace_signal_path`) submit a
short `bsub -K` worker. Log parsing, waveform reads, structural scans, KDB
detection, and Static analysis remain local. Worker failure or timeout falls
back locally to Static and is visible through fixed
`backend_status.execution_mode` / `scheduler_status` / `worker_status` /
`fallback_reason` labels; queue, host, command, and license details are not
returned.

After restarting or reconnecting the MCP server, ask the AI agent to run one
explicit connectivity operation and report `backend_status`. A successful LSF
NPI call has `execution_mode="lsf"`, `scheduler_status="completed"`,
`worker_status="completed"`, and `actual_backend="verdi_npi"`. Otherwise inspect
`fallback_reason`; a Static fallback is not an exact NPI result.

Optional settings:

```bash
export TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_TIMEOUT=120
export TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_BSUB=/path/to/bsub
export TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_BKILL=/path/to/bkill
export TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_PYTHON=/path/to/python3.11
export TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_STAGING_DIR=/shared/private/traceweave-npi
export TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_EXTRA_ARGS_JSON='["-R", "select[...]"]'
```

The KDB, TraceWeave checkout/installation, and staging directory must be
visible at the same absolute paths on the submission and compute nodes. The
staging directory defaults under TraceWeave's cache root; set it explicitly
when that cache is not on a shared filesystem. Scheduler options are JSON argv,
not shell text, and are limited to scheduler option/value pairs.

### Functional Verification

After connecting either client, run a quick end-to-end smoke test:

1. Start `codex` or `claude` inside a project directory that contains a sim log and waveform files.
2. Submit a direct waveform-debug request, for example: "Call the TraceWeave MCP. Start with `get_sim_paths` to list the logs and waves for this case."
3. Confirm that the execution log shows actual MCP tool calls such as `get_sim_paths`, `parse_sim_log`, and `search_signals` — not just shell commands reading files manually.

## Standard MCP Workflow

This is the default workflow for simulation-log and waveform debug:

1. Call `get_sim_paths(verif_root, case_name?)`. For non-standard layouts you may also pass explicit `sim_log` / `wave_file` / `compile_log` paths; any field you supply is used as-is and the omitted ones are still auto-discovered (a `sim_log` path also anchors discovery of the matching waveform and compile/elab logs). An explicit path may be absolute or relative — a relative path is resolved against `verif_root` and each of its ancestors (so a path relative to the repo root also works), and if still not found it is recovered by basename.
2. Choose the `phase == "elaborate"` compile log.
3. Run `build_tb_hierarchy` and `scan_structural_risks` in parallel on that same compile log.
4. If a sim log is present, call `parse_sim_log`; then, on a failing run with a waveform, call `sweep_handshakes` for a one-call whole-design protocol-health scan (a default-flow step, like `scan_structural_risks` at the runtime layer).
5. Use `recommend_failure_debug_next_steps` or `analyze_failure_event`.
6. Use `search_signals` and `analyze_failures` when you need waveform snapshots for explicit signals.
7. Use `explain_signal_driver`, `trace_x_source`, or `get_signals_by_cycle` for deeper investigation.
8. Use `get_diagnostic_snapshot` at any time to inspect reusable cached session state.

Important workflow rules:

- `scan_structural_risks` is part of the default workflow and should not be skipped unless the user explicitly asks to skip it.
- Use the same `compile_log` for both `build_tb_hierarchy` and `scan_structural_risks`.
- Prefer `failure_events[].time_ps` from `parse_sim_log` as the waveform time anchor.
- If `fsdb_runtime.enabled == false`, prefer `.vcd` over `.fsdb`.

## Tool Quick Reference

### Session Overview

- `get_diagnostic_snapshot`: Read-only summary of cached session data and suggested next calls; mirrors `parse_sim_log`'s `protocol_symptom_hint` so a scoreboard failure surfaces the protocol-health pointer at session start

### Paths and Hierarchy

- `get_sim_paths`: Discover compile logs, sim logs, waveforms, simulator, and cases. Optional explicit `sim_log` / `wave_file` / `compile_log` overrides win over auto-discovery; omitted fields are still discovered (anchored at the `sim_log`/`wave_file` directory)
- `build_tb_hierarchy`: Build testbench hierarchy server-side; return a slim payload (project, stats, depth-2 tree skeleton, interfaces, ambiguous_basenames, `hierarchy_handle`). Full data is reachable via the handle tools below.
- `scan_structural_risks`: Scan compiled RTL/TB sources for structural risk patterns

### Hierarchy Handle Tools

All take the `hierarchy_handle` returned by `build_tb_hierarchy`. On a stale or unknown handle they return `{"error": "handle_expired"}`; re-run `build_tb_hierarchy` to refresh.

- `get_tb_subtree(handle, root="", depth=1, max_nodes=500)`: Slice the component_tree starting at a dotted instance path.
- `lookup_tb_files(handle, ...)`: Query the compiled file set by objective scan facts (`basename`, `name_contains`, `path_contains`, `has_module`, `contains_uvm`, `file_type`). At least one filter is required. Use `basename=...` to disambiguate multi-version files reported in `ambiguous_basenames`.
- `find_tb_instance(handle, path=... | module=...)`: Locate an instance by exact path or all instances of a module.
- `get_tb_file_detail(handle, path)`: Return symbols defined in a single compiled file. Unknown paths return `file_not_in_compile_set` with basename-similar `did_you_mean` suggestions — verify file membership before any RTL read.
- `get_tb_class_hierarchy(handle, root_class?, depth=-1)`: UVM/SV class inheritance tree built from compile-set scans.
- `dump_tb_section(handle, section)`: Escape hatch for the full raw `compile_result`, `include_tree`, `filelist_tree`, `interfaces`, `files_full`, `component_tree_full`, or `class_hierarchy_full`. Prefer the targeted tools above.

### Log Analysis

- `parse_sim_log`: Parse and normalize runtime failures into grouped summaries and `failure_events`; also returns `log_snapshot_id` so same-path reruns can be compared after the simulator overwrites the log. On a scoreboard/compare-style failure it sets `protocol_symptom_hint`, a boundary-safe pointer reminding you to check bus-protocol health (run `sweep_handshakes` once for all interfaces) before reading RTL line-by-line — it never asserts a protocol type or a specific signal.
- `diff_sim_failure_results`: Compare two simulation runs by paths or by `base_snapshot_id` / `new_snapshot_id`. If only `new_log_path` is supplied after an earlier `parse_sim_log` of the same path, TraceWeave uses the previous parsed snapshot as the baseline.
- `get_error_context`: Extract raw log context around a specific line

### Waveform Analysis

- `search_signals`: Resolve full hierarchical signal paths. `keyword` accepts a single string or a **list of keywords** (max 16) — pass a list to batch several lookups in one call (one result entry per keyword, in input order) instead of issuing consecutive single-keyword searches. Each result also carries `direction` (`input`/`output`/`inout`/`implicit`/`null`) and `var_type` (`wire`/`reg`/`integer`/`real`/`parameter`/…), so clients can filter ports/nets/variables in a chosen scope without a separate tool. **FSDB** populates both fields; **VCD** populates only `var_type` and returns `direction: null` (the VCD format does not encode port direction)
- `get_signal_at_time`: Query a signal value at a specific timestamp
- `get_signal_transitions`: Retrieve transitions for a signal over time. Returns at most `max_transitions` entries (default 1000, earliest in range kept); a clipped result sets `truncated: true` + a `hint`. When bounded native FSDB output is also truncated, `transition_count_is_lower_bound=true`; narrow the time range for complete data. Otherwise `transition_count` reports the total found, and the explicit return cap can be raised for bulk extraction
- `get_signals_around_time`: Retrieve context around a failure timestamp. Flags a `value_at_center` that is a **sub-cycle transient** (a combinational glitch at the clock edge that settles back within the same cycle — e.g. an interconnect mux re-settling to idle for ~1ns) via `transient_note` + per-signal `center_transient`/`center_settles_to`, so an edge-sampled glitch is not misread as the settled protocol value. `return_mode="values_only"` keeps the atomic multi-signal sample but strips the transition lists (each signal returns `value_at_center` + `window_transition_count` + any transient annotation) — the compact shape for comparing one time point across several traces. `extra_transitions=0` is honored strictly: zero pre-window history.
- `get_signals_by_cycle`: Sample signals cycle-by-cycle on a clock edge
- `get_waveform_summary`: Return waveform metadata. Includes a time-scale self-check: `scale_unit` (the scale read from the waveform header, e.g. `100fs`/`1ps`/`1ns`; `unknown` when unreadable) and `scale_fs_per_tick` — all timestamps in tool output are real picoseconds converted with this factor, never raw file ticks. When the scale is unreadable the summary carries a `scale_warning` and every time-based query on that waveform is refused instead of silently assuming a 1ps scale

### Cursors and Verification Primitives

Time inputs on `get_signal_at_time`, `get_signal_transitions`, `get_signals_around_time`, `trace_x_source`, and `diff_first_divergence` accept a **TimeSpec**: a raw integer (ps), a cursor reference `@<name>`, or a unit literal such as `12.34ns` / `5us`.

- `cursor_set(name, time_ps, note?)` / `cursor_list()` / `cursor_delete(name)`: Named, process-scoped time anchors. Tools that locate an instant (e.g. `diff_first_divergence`, `period`) auto-register a cursor you can later reference as `@<name>` instead of copying ps timestamps across calls. Cursors are not persisted — server restart drops them.
- `diff_first_divergence(wave_path_a, signal_a, wave_path_b, signal_b, ...)`: First time two waveform signals hold unequal values — across two waveforms (e.g. passing vs failing run) or within one (two signals that should match, e.g. lockstep / shadow registers). Auto-registers a cursor at the divergence. Requires both sides to be dumped waveform signals (it does not compare against a software reference model).
- `period(wave_path, signal, edge?, ...)`: Dominant edge-to-edge period of a signal and the first beat that deviates from it (off-beat), auto-registered as a cursor. For "this signal should be periodic — where did the cadence first break?" (clocks, strobes, fixed-rate valids).
- `suggest_handshakes(wave_path, scope?, ...)`: Scans the waveform and proposes ready-to-use `inspect_handshake` bundles — pairs `*valid`/`*ready` by scope and stem, finds the clock, and groups the channel payload buses. Run it first so you don't hand-assemble `{clock, valid, ready, payload}`. Covers AXI/generic valid-ready and req/ack. When it finds nothing, a lightweight name probe (`htrans`→AHB, `psel`+`penable`→APB) upgrades the empty-result hint into a copy-paste-ready `suggest_protocol_bundles` call.
- `suggest_protocol_bundles(wave_path, protocol=ahb|apb, scope?, ...)`: Scans for protocol-specific bundles where there is no literal `valid`. AHB candidates return ready-to-use `inspect_handshake` args with `valid_htrans`, `ready`, and payload; APB candidates return `psel`/`penable`/`pready` facts and loudly report that `inspect_handshake` still needs a derived valid signal for `psel && penable`. For AHB candidates the result also returns a `next_step` field — a copy-paste-ready `inspect_handshake(...)` call per interface — because discovery only locates the bundle; the analysis is the `inspect_handshake` run. Direction tags are mechanical discovery facts only (`initiator_side` / `responder_side` / `unknown`), with unknown/conflicting markers reported rather than guessed.
- `inspect_handshake(wave_path, clock, valid, ready, payload?, ...)`: Cycle-by-cycle classification of a clocked valid/ready handshake — stall runs (valid high, ready low), the longest/over-threshold stalls, backpressure imbalance (ready high, valid low), and, when `payload` signals are given, payload-hold violations (a payload that changes while the transfer is still stalled). It also flags **premature valid deassertion** (`check_valid_hold`, default on): a stalled beat whose valid/htrans goes inactive the next edge — before ready/HREADY arrived — is the master dropping the transfer instead of waiting (the AHB master-not-waiting-for-HREADY bug). This needs no `payload` and catches what payload-hold structurally cannot: a 1-cycle stall (`max_stall_cycles==1`) never lets payload change, and htrans (the derived valid) is not a payload signal. Protocol-agnostic: AXI `*valid`/`*ready`, generic valid-ready streams, or credit interfaces. For AHB there is no literal valid — pass `valid_htrans=<htrans path>` (and `htrans_rule`: `active`=NONSEQ/SEQ, or `non_idle`) and a derived valid is computed (with `payload`=haddr/hwrite/hsize which must hold while hready is low; HWDATA/HRDATA are excluded as data-phase, so the hold check cannot false-positive on the address/data phase offset). For an AHB interface a third check, **x_while_valid**, flags a control field that is x/z while the derived valid is asserted — an active transfer carrying an unknown address/control field; it stays off for a literal-`valid` interface whose payload may be legally-x data lanes (a false positive). A separate **write data-phase hold** check (pass `hwrite` + `write_data`=HWDATA) verifies HWDATA stays stable through a write data-phase wait state (HREADY low) — a `write_data_hold_violation`; this is the data-phase window, one cycle behind the address-phase valid, that the htrans-keyed payload-hold cannot see (and why HWDATA is excluded from `payload`). It is sound only on the producer (initiator/master) interface — a responder interface's HWDATA is an interconnect-mux output that glitches at the clock edge — so `suggest_protocol_bundles` attaches `hwrite`/`write_data` only to initiator-side bundles. On AHB the result also carries a `protocol_semantics` receipt naming which metrics are faithful vs suppressed (valid-hold faithful; `ready_without_valid` is idle-bus, not a violation; payload-hold address-phase only), and the premature-deassertion finding carries `accepted_before_deassert=False` (the dropped beat was never accepted) — so a true positive cannot be waved away as AHB pipeline overlap. Returns `coverage` facts for checks it actually ran (`stall_checked`, `backpressure_checked`, `payload_hold_checked`/partial, `valid_hold_checked`, `x_while_valid_checked`), without assigning protocol side. Auto-registers a cursor at the first problem (x-while-valid > hold violation > premature deassertion > long stall > longest stall). On a finding it sets `violating_signal` (the held signal for a payload-hold, the x'd control field for an x-while-valid, the valid/htrans for a premature deassertion; `null` for a plain stall) and a `next_actions` link to `explain_signal_driver`. For the **one-sided** violations (x-while-valid, payload-hold, premature deassertion) it also returns a structured `attribution` block — `violating_side=valid_driver`, `exonerated_side=ready_driver` — because both are breaches of the valid-driver's obligation (payload travels with valid; only the producer can mutate payload mid-stall or drop valid before acceptance), so the responder/ready side **cannot** cause them: don't start in the slave driver/monitor. This is protocol role, not trace-ownership: the valid-driver is the channel producer (master on AXI AW/AR/W, slave on R/B; AHB htrans is always master) — `explain_signal_driver` on `valid` lands on the actual instance. A plain stall is genuinely two-sided, so `attribution` stays empty and the link targets `ready`. Surfaces protocol-timing facts that leave no value pattern in scoreboard logs.
- `sweep_handshakes(wave_path, scope?, ...)`: Whole-design handshake **anomaly sweep** — discovers every valid/ready interface **and every AHB interface** (htrans-derived valid) and inspects each over the window in one call, returning a comparative fact table (per-interface `kind`=`valid_ready`/`ahb`, stalls, deadlock signature, x-while-valid, payload-hold, write-data-hold, premature valid deassertion, backpressure) ordered by a transparent mechanical key (on an `ahb` row `ready_without_valid` is suppressed from `flags` and the sort — it is idle-bus, not backpressure). Interfaces sharing a clock reuse one transition read, edge extraction, and sample-time vector; signals shared across interfaces are cached only until their last consumer, while unique payloads are not retained. On FSDB, a bounded native group loads a clock group's signals once and still reads each signal independently through the reusable per-call output buffer; older wrappers, groups over the conservative 16-signal default, and native begin failures fall back automatically to the legacy path (`TRACEWEAVE_FSDB_GROUP_MAX_SIGNALS` adjusts the limit after RSS review). This changes execution cost, not the MCP interface, fact table, truncation receipts, or coverage semantics. This is the one-call protocol-health check the scoreboard-failure hint steers toward (APB excluded — needs a derived valid; clocking-block `*_cb` mirror scopes are dropped — no own clock, redundant with the parent interface). For opaque global symptoms (timeout/hang) when you don't yet know which of many interfaces misbehaves; it collapses N `suggest_handshakes`+`inspect_handshake` round-trips into one. Returns facts, not a root-cause verdict — re-rank as the symptom warrants. On a backpressured pipeline the worst-stall ordering surfaces the propagation front, while the root is the stall→starvation boundary. The result includes `coverage_status` (`complete`/`truncated`/`zero_coverage`/`degraded`) plus `coverage_warnings`; `flagged_count=0` is only meaningful when coverage is complete. In particular, a scoped sweep with `zero_coverage` checked no interfaces and is not a protocol pass; retry unscoped or with a parent/interface scope. Sets `truncated=true` (loudly) when discovery exceeds `max_interfaces` (default 64).
- `verify_window(wave_path, clock, mode, predicate | antecedent+consequent, ...)`: Evaluate a temporal predicate over a clock window and return a precise `holds` verdict plus a concrete witness/counterexample (cycle + sampled values). Templates, not a DSL: a *term* is `{signal, op, value}` (`op`: eq/ne/gt/ge/lt/le/is_x/is_known); a *predicate* is a list of terms (implicit AND); `mode` is `always` / `never` / `eventually` / `implication` (A ⊦→ B within N cycles) / `sequence` (per-accepted-beat increment of one signal — address-stride checks; `predicate` is the accepted-beat gate, `delta`=`{signal,value,op?,modulo?,restart_when?}`, where `modulo` absorbs WRAP wrap-around and `restart_when` re-seeds at burst starts, both supplied by you so the tool stays burst-decode-free). `implication` takes an `overlap` flag: default `true` (`|->`, response window includes A's own cycle) or `false` (`|=>`, window starts the NEXT cycle) — use `overlap=false` for a **stability/hold** property ("B must STILL hold next cycle", e.g. AHB `HTRANS`/valid held through a wait state: `(htrans==2 && hready==0) |=> htrans==2`), where A already implies B on its own cycle. With `overlap=true` such a property is a **vacuous pass** (B already true on A's cycle, the window never matters) — the result is flagged `vacuous=true` with a loud `VACUOUS PASS` warning so a `holds=true` is not misread as exclusion evidence; re-run with `overlap=false`. x/z cycles are reported as `unknown` (never silently passed) and an implication whose response window runs past end-of-trace is `inconclusive` (never silently failed). On a `sequence` violation it sets `violating_signal` + a `next_actions` link to `explain_signal_driver` (bus facts do not self-attribute master/slave). Use to prove or disprove an RTL inference in one call.
- `reconstruct_transactions(wave_path, clock, req_valid, req_ready, cmp_valid, cmp_ready, ...)`: Reconstruct id-correlated request/response transactions from two handshake channels — match accepted request beats to completion beats by an `id` field and return per-transaction latency plus aggregate facts (outstanding curve incl. per-id peak, ordering, unmatched = hang signature). One generic core, not a tool per protocol: AXI read = AR→R (`req_id`=arid, `cmp_id`=rid, `cmp_last`=rlast); AXI write = AW→B plus an optional unindexed W-data channel (`data_valid`/`data_ready`/`data_last` + `data_fields`). `req_id`/`cmp_id` are optional — omit both for an unindexed in-order stream (AXI-Lite, APB), which pairs in FIFO order. An optional `reset` clears in-flight state so a transaction straddling reset is not a phantom hang. An optional `req_len` (AxLEN) checks each txn's `beat_count` against `req_len+1` — a mismatch (early/late LAST, dropped/extra beat) is surfaced per-txn (`expected_beats`, `beat_count_mismatch`) and as `beat_count_mismatch_count` (x/z len → not checked; no `req_len` → count 0 = not checked, not a clean verdict). `latency` is a distribution, not an "outlier" verdict; out-of-order completion across ids is supported.

FSDB coverage note: native transition output is bounded. If an inspected clock
or signal returns only a prefix, the affected handshake row sets
`transition_data_truncated`, the sweep increments `transition_truncated_count`,
and `coverage_status` is not `complete`; zero findings then apply only to the
returned prefix. Narrow the time window for a complete targeted check.

### Deep-Dive Analysis

- `analyze_failures`: Focus on one grouped failure and return log plus waveform context
- `analyze_failure_event`: Rank likely instances, source files, and signals for a specific `failure_event`
- `recommend_failure_debug_next_steps`: Return the default next debug target
- `explain_signal_driver`: Trace a waveform signal back to likely RTL driver logic
- `find_signal_loads`: List the consumers (fanout) of a signal — module-input ports, RHS uses, always-block sensitivity
- `trace_signal_path`: Find a connectivity path between two signals in the elaborated netlist (NPI-only). Returns connectivity, NOT temporal driver direction — use `explain_signal_driver` for driver semantics. Without a Verdi KDB this tool returns `unsupported_reason="static_backend_no_path_api"` because source-regex cannot honestly reproduce `sig_to_sig_conn_list`; fall back to `explain_signal_driver` + `find_signal_loads` in that case.
- `trace_x_source`: Trace X/Z propagation upstream
- `build_kdb`: Auto-build a Verdi KDB from the parsed compile log (vericom + elabcom). Use when the simulator is Xcelium (xrun) and the NPI backend reports no KDB. Output is cached under `TRACEWEAVE_CACHE_DIR` (default `~/.cache/traceweave/kdb/<hash>/`); cache hits skip re-running Verdi. A runnable `build.sh` is written next to the KDB for inspection or manual reproduction. Requires `VERDI_HOME` with `bin/vericom` and `bin/elabcom`.

`explain_signal_driver`, `find_signal_loads`, and `trace_signal_path` automatically engage a Verdi NPI backend when a KDB is detected. The first two transparently fall back to a Static source-regex backend when NPI is unavailable; `trace_signal_path` is NPI-only and returns a structured `unsupported_reason` instead of an approximation, since `sig_to_sig_conn_list` has no honest static equivalent. NPI is the deep / accurate path: it walks the elaborated netlist with `fan_in_reg_list` / `sig_to_sig_conn_list`, so it can cross instance port boundaries, interface positional bindings, and assign chains that Static cannot follow. In **local NPI execution mode**, a detected KDB also lets `build_tb_hierarchy` overlay each component-tree node's `source_file` / `source_line` with NPI's elaborated `file:line`. The initial LSF scope deliberately does not submit an implicit batch job from `build_tb_hierarchy`, so in LSF mode that hierarchy source information remains compile-log-derived. Affected hops in `find_driver` / `find_loads` results carry a `source_info_origin: "npi"` tag so consumers can tell NPI-annotated entries from compile-log-derived ones. The result envelope carries a `backend_status` block with the active backend, KDB flow, and a per-simulator `kdb_hint`. NPI is deep but not infallible: when the *only* driver it can report for a net is also a LOAD of that net (an interface-slice alias, or a register that reads the net), there is no RTL driver and the real driver is testbench/behavioral — a UVM driver writing through a virtual interface + clocking block, which RTL register fan-in cannot see. `explain_signal_driver` detects this contradiction with a driver-vs-loads cross-check and returns `driver_status="testbench_driven"` (with a `cross_check.conflict` receipt) instead of naming the load as an "exact" driver — so an AHB master's HTRANS/HADDR points you at the TB driver/BFM, not at a DUT interconnect register that merely reads the bus.

For VCS flows the cheapest way to get a KDB is to recompile with `-kdb=only` — the hint surfaces the exact command. For Xcelium flows there is no native KDB; `get_diagnostic_snapshot` will list `build_kdb` in `missing_steps` so the LLM agent can produce one on demand. Set `TRACEWEAVE_AUTO_KDB=0` to opt out of the auto-build suggestion.

### Usage telemetry

When enabled, TraceWeave appends one JSONL line per tool call to `$TRACEWEAVE_CACHE_DIR/telemetry/usage.jsonl` (default `~/.cache/traceweave/telemetry/`) — tool name, argument *keys* and a few scalar flags (never argument values or paths), result size, latency, a session id anchored to each `get_sim_paths` case, and on failed calls a classification `error_code` (a code or exception class name, never the message). It is **local-only** (nothing is sent anywhere) and exists to quantify which tools actually get used. The normal user default is that `TRACEWEAVE_TELEMETRY` is absent; recording is then disabled and no telemetry file is written. To opt in, set `TRACEWEAVE_TELEMETRY=1` before starting the MCP server, then restart or reconnect it after changing the value. Summarize with `python scripts/telemetry_report.py`.
