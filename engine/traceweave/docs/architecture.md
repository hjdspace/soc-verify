# Architecture

## System Shape

TraceWeave is a workflow-oriented debug server. The core architecture is not
just "parse log + parse wave"; it combines workflow gating, source-aware
analysis, waveform backends, and extended debug capabilities.

## Notes

- `server.py` is both the composition root and the workflow gate; tool ordering,
  prerequisite enforcement, session-compatible cache reuse, and in-process
  parsed-log snapshots for same-path simulation reruns live there.
- Wave-touching tool bodies (`get_signal_*`, `get_signals_*`, `search_signals`,
  `get_waveform_summary`, `trace_x_source`, `period`/`diff_first_divergence`,
  `suggest_*`, `sweep_handshakes`, `inspect_handshake`, `verify_window`,
  `reconstruct_transactions`) are synchronous and CPU-bound, so `_dispatch`
  runs them in a worker thread via `_run_in_wave_thread` instead of inline in
  the async coroutine — otherwise one heavy scan starves the event loop
  (head-of-line blocking of every queued request) and client cancellation can
  never be delivered. Parser access is serialized by wave locks acquired
  inside the worker: one global lock for ALL FSDB work (the Verdi ffr API
  makes no thread-safety promise even across handles), a per-path lock for
  VCD. Cancellation is cooperative (`src/cancellation.py`): the dispatch layer
  arms a per-call `threading.Event` when the request task is cancelled
  (client `notifications/cancelled` or disconnect), and the scan loops in
  `cycle_query` / `handshake_sweep` / `verify_condition` / `window_verify` /
  `txn_reconstruct` call `check_cancelled()` at stride checkpoints. Handshake
  discovery also checks immediately before and after every `search_signals`
  call and between its valid/ready and AHB phases; `OperationCancelled` is
  explicitly re-raised rather than swallowed by best-effort discovery error
  handling. Thus an abandoned multi-minute sweep stops at the next Python
  checkpoint. A synchronous native search cannot yet be interrupted from
  inside that call; cancellation is observed as soon as it returns. A call
  cancelled while still queued on a wave lock gives up
  without ever touching the parser. A client-side read timeout is not
  guaranteed to emit an MCP cancellation notification, so an interactive
  FSDB call waiting behind background `sweep_handshakes` also arms the sweep's
  cooperative cancel event. The sweep releases the global lock at its next
  checkpoint and the interactive call proceeds; FFR access remains globally
  serialized and never overlaps. Loop-side state (`_result_cache`,
  `_session_state`, provenance) is still written only on the event-loop
  thread; the worker computes, the loop remains the single writer.
  Privacy-safe operation metrics make full-sweep cost attributable without
  recording project identities: discovery/search timing, total sweep time,
  planned/attempted/completed interface counts, unique clock/signal counts,
  aggregate/max inspect time, clock-vs-signal transition read count/total/max,
  edge-extraction/value-sampling time, shared-clock/shared-signal reuse-hit
  counts, and transition-truncated interface count. The FSDB path additionally
  reports aggregate native lookup/load/seek/traverse/unload phases, group-load
  use/fallback counts, transition/output volume, sampling shape, cache peaks,
  result build/serialization cost, and process RSS start/peak/end. All fields
  are numeric or fixed-label aggregates; paths, scopes, signal names, values,
  and search keywords are never recorded.
- A full `sweep_handshakes` does not independently reread and re-extract the
  same clock for every interface. `handshake_sweep` groups discovered bundles
  by clock and creates one private `EdgeSamplingSession` per group;
  `cycle_query` reads the clock transitions, extracts edges, and builds sample
  times once, then reuses them for every interface in that group. Signals used
  by more than one interface are also reused, with a remaining-consumer count
  that evicts each transition list immediately after its final consumer.
  Unique payload signals are never retained. Groups are consumed one at a time,
  so the implementation does not keep all design clocks in memory. This is an
  internal execution optimization: MCP inputs/results, coverage semantics,
  cancellation checkpoints, and the process-global FSDB lock are unchanged.
  `scripts/benchmark_sweep_shared_clock.py` is the reproducible structural
  benchmark for this path. On a warmed generated VCD with 32 independent
  valid/ready interfaces, one shared clock, 20,000 cycles, and three repeats,
  the same workload measured 28,492.5 ms median before grouping and 13,986.8 ms
  after (50.9% lower). Clock reads/edge extractions fell from 32 to 1; maximum
  incremental `tracemalloc` peak changed from 32.45 to 33.13 MiB (+0.68 MiB,
  +2.1%). This validates the repeated-clock optimization, not a 5-minute promise
  for a proprietary FSDB whose native signal reads may have a different cost
  profile.
- Full sweeps use a private column-oriented sampler: one edge-time vector and
  one value-reference column per signal. They do not materialize `time_ns`, a
  per-edge `signals` dictionary, or a normalized `{bin,hex,dec}` copy for every
  sampled value. Standalone sampling tools retain their existing row-oriented
  result schema. `inspect_handshake` consumes either representation with
  identical facts, and advances the AHB write-data hold state machine in the
  same pass as the main handshake state machine. Signal lookup uses a monotonic
  transition cursor (with a bisect fallback only for unexpected decreasing
  sample times), preserving duplicate-timestamp and pre-first-transition
  behavior. On the same generated 32-interface/one-clock/20,000-cycle VCD
  benchmark above, three runs measured 11,473.8 ms median and 19.80 MiB maximum
  incremental `tracemalloc` peak: 18.0% lower elapsed time and 40.2% lower peak
  than the previous 13,986.8 ms / 33.13 MiB grouped implementation. A separate
  1,000,000-sample/50,000-transition lookup benchmark measured 3.3x speedup
  over the former per-sample bisect oracle with equal values.
- For FSDB clock groups, `FSDBParser.transition_group()` uses an optional native
  ABI to add the group's resolved signals once, call `ffrLoadSignals()` once,
  read each signal independently through the existing reusable 64 MiB per-call
  output buffer, and unload in a `finally` block. This removes repeated
  per-signal load/unload without adopting the multi-signal batch output format
  or changing truncation receipts. The default
  native group limit is 16 signals to bound resident FFR data on multi-GB waves;
  the sweep scheduler first-fit packs complete small clock units into that
  bound. An oversized clock unit is split only at interface boundaries while
  retaining one `EdgeSamplingSession`: the first chunk reads/caches the clock,
  later chunks load only their signal subset, and a single interface that
  itself exceeds the bound falls back honestly. This removes whole-group
  oversized fallback without raising the resident-signal limit. Packs remain
  serial under the process-global FSDB lock and every native group unloads in
  its existing `finally` path.
  `TRACEWEAVE_FSDB_GROUP_MAX_SIGNALS` can set 1..256 after RSS review. Oversized
  groups, begin failures, and older wrappers automatically use the legacy
  per-signal path. Cancellation between interfaces unwinds the context before
  releasing the process-global FSDB lock. On the bundled warmed wide-bus FSDB
  fixture (7 signals, 50 load/read/unload iterations per repeat, 7 alternating
  repeats), the grouped median was 23.644 ms versus 25.773 ms legacy (8.3%
  lower), with identical transition counts and truncation receipts. This
  validates the mechanism only; the one-run metrics are required to judge a
  proprietary workload.
- `scripts/benchmark_sweep_fsdb_group.py` compares complete sweep results while
  alternating forced-legacy and grouped runs, and emits aggregates only. On a
  local 34,874-byte AHB repro FSDB (634 signals, four discovered interfaces,
  5 repeats), both paths returned byte-equivalent fact tables with complete
  coverage and no transition truncation. The packed/grouped median was
  47.807 ms versus 50.523 ms forced-legacy (5.4% lower); four clock units fit
  into three native packs (maximum 16 resident signals) with no fallback. This
  is a protocol/compatibility sample, not evidence about multi-GB scaling.
- `src/path_discovery.py`, `src/compile_log_parser.py`, `src/log_parser.py`, and
  `src/analyzer.py` form the main failure-analysis path from artifacts to
  normalized failures and recommended next steps.
- `src/tb_hierarchy_builder.py`, `src/signal_driver.py` and `src/signal_load.py`
  turn the system into a source-aware debug assistant rather than a parser-only
  tool. `signal_driver` traces back to drivers; `signal_load` finds the
  consumers (fanout) of a signal.
- `src/connectivity_backend.py` defines a `ConnectivityBackend` protocol with
  `find_driver`, `find_loads`, and `find_path` methods. `select_backend()`
  returns local `VerdiNpiBackend` when a Verdi KDB is available, or
  `LsfConnectivityBackend` when `TRACEWEAVE_NPI_EXECUTION=lsf`; its queue comes
  only from the namespaced `TRACEWEAVE_NPI_LSF_QUEUE`. Users normally set that
  variable directly; an already-existing site/team variable may optionally be
  mapped to it in the launching shell. TraceWeave never creates or interprets a
  generic scheduler queue variable. Without a KDB it returns the static
  source-regex backend directly. Both NPI execution
  policies wrap Static at the parent: local NPI failures degrade in-process,
  while an LSF worker returns exact NPI or a fixed failure receipt and the
  login-node parent performs the fallback. `find_path` is NPI-only: Static returns
  `unsupported_reason="static_backend_no_path_api"` rather than approximating
  with regex, since `sig_to_sig_conn_list` walks the elaborated netlist
  across assigns / interfaces / generates that source-regex cannot follow
  reliably.
- `src/npi_lsf.py` owns the versioned, exact-only worker protocol and the
  optional `bsub -K` transport. It writes one private request under a
  shared staging root, submits an identity-free random job name, validates the
  response against the existing operation schema, and exposes only fixed
  execution labels. Remote stdout/stderr is fixed to `/dev/null` so LSF does
  not email native license output; the local scheduler client output is held
  only in the private request directory. The synchronous scheduler wait runs in
  `server._run_in_cancellable_thread`; cancellation or timeout performs a
  bounded `bkill -J` followed by termination of the local `bsub` waiter.
  `src/npi_worker.py` invokes the local NPI core directly and never Static, so
  a compute-node license/load failure cannot be mistaken for an exact answer.
  The hierarchy source overlay remains local/optional in the initial scope and
  does not implicitly submit a batch job.
- `src/verdi_backend.py` is a pure-detection probe: it locates KDB at
  `simv.daidir/kdb.elab++` (VCS two-step) or via `synopsys_sim.setup` work-lib
  mappings (three-step / vericom standalone) and emits a per-simulator
  `kdb_hint` (e.g. the exact `vcs -kdb=only` command for a VCS user, the
  `vericom -kdb` command for an Xcelium user) when KDB is missing.
- `src/verdi_npi_backend.py` lazily imports `pynpi` from `$VERDI_HOME` (zero
  hardcoded prefixes), holds a single design across calls keyed on
  `kdb_path`, and re-issues `npisys.load_design` to switch cases within one
  session. Synthesized PinHdl paths (`scope:Construct#Op:line:line:Cell.Port`)
  are normalized to FSDB-visible scopes; raw form is preserved in `expr` for
  diagnostics. Additional NPI-only capabilities: `find_path` wraps
  `sig_to_sig_conn_list` for the `trace_signal_path` MCP tool, and
  `collect_instance_src_map` walks `netlist.get_top_inst_list()` recursively
  to overlay elaborated `file:line` onto compile-log-derived hierarchy
  nodes; `LoadHop` / `DriverChainHop` / hierarchy nodes carry a
  `source_info_origin` field (`"compile_log"` vs `"npi"`) so consumers can
  tell which provenance produced each `file:line`.
- `src/structural_scanner.py` and `src/x_trace.py` are first-class extended
  analysis capabilities and should not be treated as optional side scripts.
- `src/schemas.py` and `src/problem_hints.py` are support layers for structured
  output contracts and lightweight analysis annotations.
- `src/hierarchy_handles.py` owns the in-process `HandleStore` and
  content-addressed handle derivation for the slim `build_tb_hierarchy`
  payload. `src/handle_tools.py` implements the six handle tools
  (get_tb_subtree, lookup_tb_files, find_tb_instance, get_tb_file_detail,
  get_tb_class_hierarchy, dump_tb_section) as pure functions over a
  resolved full hierarchy dict.
- `src/fsdb_parser.py` is the Python/native boundary and resolves FSDB runtime
  from repo-local links first, then `VERDI_HOME`. Time contract at this
  boundary: FSDB tags are tick counts, real time = tick × header scale
  (`ffrGetScaleUnit()`, read once at `fsdb_open`). All tick↔ps conversion is
  collared in two `fsdb_wrapper.cpp` helpers (`_ToTag` floor / `_TagToPs`
  ceil, integer-fs base), so every timestamp crossing into Python is real
  picoseconds. Unknown scale → time-based calls refuse
  (`FSDB_ERR_SCALE_UNKNOWN`) rather than assume 1ps. Native text buffers also
  reserve space for an
  `@TRUNCATED` receipt. `get_transitions` propagates that receipt through
  edge sampling and handshake inspection; a sweep with any partial transition
  prefix cannot report `coverage_status="complete"`. `get_waveform_summary`
  exposes `scale_unit`/`scale_fs_per_tick` for self-check. The transition-group
  ABI is optional and detected by symbol presence, so an old locally built
  wrapper remains functional through the legacy path; rebuilding the wrapper
  and reconnecting the server is required to activate group loading.
- `src/waveform_batch.py` provides `WaveformBatchReader` — a time-window
  multi-signal reader with FSDB and VCD implementations sharing the same
  shape. The FSDB path uses `ffrCreateTimeBasedVCTrvsHdl` for a single
  chronological walk; the VCD path is pure Python.

## Handle-based Hierarchy Access

`build_tb_hierarchy` generates a full hierarchy result server-side (project
metadata, grouped file list, complete `component_tree`, `class_hierarchy`,
raw `compile_result`, per-file scan results) but returns only a **slim
payload** to the LLM: project, stats, depth-2 `tree_skeleton`, interfaces,
`ambiguous_basenames`, and a content-addressed `hierarchy_handle`. The
full result is registered in an in-process `HandleStore`
(`src/hierarchy_handles.py`) keyed by the handle.

Six handle tools (`src/handle_tools.py`) resolve a handle and return
targeted slices:

| Tool | Returns |
|---|---|
| `get_tb_subtree` | Slice of `component_tree` rooted at a dotted instance path |
| `lookup_tb_files` | Compiled-file query by objective scan facts (basename, file_type, contains_uvm, has_module, ...) |
| `find_tb_instance` | Instance lookup by exact path or by module name |
| `get_tb_file_detail` | Symbols defined in a single compiled file |
| `get_tb_class_hierarchy` | UVM/SV class inheritance tree |
| `dump_tb_section` | Raw section escape hatch (`compile_result`, `include_tree`, ...) |

Handle format: `tbh_<sha8>` derived from absolute compile_log path,
simulator, and compile_log mtime. Recompilation changes mtime and
therefore the handle, automatically invalidating prior references.

Lifecycle:

- Handles live only in-process (no persistence). Server restart drops every
  handle.
- `_invalidate_downstream("build_tb_hierarchy")` and `_clear_result_state()`
  both call `_handle_store.invalidate()`, so cache invalidation is symmetric.
- Unknown handles return `HandleErrorResult{error: "handle_expired"}` with
  HTTP 200 so the LLM can read and react.

Why this shape:

- The file list is still served (`lookup_tb_files`), because only the
  compile log is the source of truth for which version of `xxx.v` was
  actually built. Hiding it would break multi-version disambiguation.
- The tree is no longer returned in full; the depth-2 skeleton gives the
  LLM a navigable starting point and `child_count` tells it where to
  drill.
- Downstream Python tools (`analyzer`, `signal_driver`, etc.) re-parse the
  compile log via `parse_compile_log`; they do not consume the LLM-facing
  payload, so shrinking it does not break them.

The legacy full-fat payload remains accessible behind
`TRACEWEAVE_LEGACY_HIERARCHY_PAYLOAD=1` as a one-release migration safety
net, validated against `BuildTbHierarchyResultLegacy`.

## Connectivity Backend Cooperation (NPI vs Static)

NPI is the **deep / accurate** path; Static is the **cheap fallback** that
runs when NPI cannot be loaded. Once NPI is loaded, queries stay in NPI even
when the result is `unsupported` — the backend tag in the response always
reflects who actually answered.

    └── normal driver                 → single-hop format
```

**Key properties:**

- Static appears in answers only when NPI could not be loaded at all (KDB
  missing, license unavailable, pynpi import failure). Inside the NPI happy
  path Static is never consulted.
- The "boundary-only" detection upgrades dead-end results (where
  `driver_list` returns the queried net's own hierarchy port — i.e. no
  synthesized cell tag, no `:` in the name) to a `fan_in_reg_list` walk,
  which transparently crosses module port boundaries on the elaborated
  netlist. This is why NPI can resolve drivers that Static cannot reach.
- `top_scope_name` for fan-in is derived from `signal_path.split(".", 1)[0]`
  — driven by the query, not by project-specific config — so the bound is
  correct across designs without hardcoding any top name.
- **Driver-vs-loads cross-check.** A net cannot be both driven by and read
  into the same elaborated pin, so when the reported driver's raw identity
  (modulo bit-indexing) is byte-identical to one of the net's own loads, that
  "driver" is a load-alias (interface slice / a register reading the net), not
  the source. NPI's register fan-in cannot see a procedural UVM driver (virtual
  interface + clocking block), so on such a net it can walk to a nearby LOAD
  register inside the DUT and mislabel it the driver (the AHB-master-HTRANS →
  matrix `lock_owner` misattribution). The cross-check (`driver_is_load_alias`
  + `_loadcheck_head`, fed by the net's own `load_list()`) promotes a genuine
  RTL driver if one remains, else returns `driver_status="testbench_driven"`
  with a `cross_check.conflict` receipt — never a load named as an `exact`
  driver. Byte-identical matching keeps it FP-safe: a real `q <= q + 1`
  counter loads into a distinct `Add`/`Assignment` cell, so it never matches.
  The decision is keyed on the **original `driver_list`** and short-circuits
  *before* fan-in, so it covers `recursive=True` too — under recursion fan-in
  walks to a downstream LOAD register (the matrix `lock_owner` that reads the
  net), which is in the net's fan-OUT, not its `load_list`, so a fan-in-keyed
  compare would miss; widening the load set to fan-OUT is wrong because a
  self-counter's own `Reg` is in its fan-out (the feedback).
- For Xcelium / `xrun` flows there is no KDB by default. NPI requires a
  separate `vericom -kdb` + `elabcom -elab kdb` pass over the same
  sources. When `AUTO_KDB_BUILD` is on (default), TraceWeave's
  `build_kdb` MCP tool will run those two commands for the user; the
  Static fallback is only used while no KDB exists yet.

## Auto-KDB build for Xcelium (`build_kdb` tool)

When the active simulator is Xcelium and the KDB probe finds nothing,
the diagnostic snapshot lists `build_kdb` in `missing_steps`. Calling
`build_kdb(compile_log=...)` runs vericom + elabcom against the file
list, defines, and include paths parsed out of the compile log, and
caches the resulting KDB under a project-agnostic cache root.

```text
build_kdb(compile_log)
├── parse_compile_log → top, files, defines, incdirs, UVM flag
├── hash = sha256(top + sorted(files + mtimes) + sorted(defines)
│                 + sorted(incdirs) + uvm_bit)
├── cache_dir = $TRACEWEAVE_CACHE_DIR/kdb/<hash>/
├── if cache_dir/state.json says ok → return cached, no Verdi spawn
└── else build in $TRACEWEAVE_CACHE_DIR/kdb/.tmp-<hash>-<pid>/
    ├── write build.sh (regenerated every rebuild; runnable standalone)
    ├── vericom -sv -kdb [-ntb_opts uvm] [+define+...] [+incdir+...]

    ├── elabcom -lib work.lib++ -elab kdb -top <top>

    ├── on success: rename tmp → cache_dir (atomic, replaces stale entry)
    └── on failure: rename tmp → .failed-<hash>/ (preserved for inspection;
                      existing cache_dir untouched)
```

Cache layout under `$TRACEWEAVE_CACHE_DIR/kdb/<hash>/`:

| File / dir | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `kdb.elab++/` | Elaborated KDB. NPI's `-simflow -dbdir` target. |
| `work.lib++/` | vericom source-lib output. |
| `build.sh` | Runnable reproducer; written every build. Lets users see/run the exact vericom+elabcom commands TraceWeave invoked. |
| `vericom.log` | stdout+stderr of vericom phase. |
| `elabcom.log` | stdout+stderr of elabcom phase. |
| `state.json` | Inputs hash, status (`ok`/`failed`), timestamps. |

The probe picks up these cached KDBs automatically (`kdb_flow:
"traceweave_cached"`), so the same find_driver / find_loads call that
falls back to Static today starts answering through NPI after one
`build_kdb` invocation. User-managed KDBs (`simv.daidir/kdb.elab++` or
`vericom`-built `*.lib++` in the user's work dir) still win the probe
order — TraceWeave's cache is the fallback, never the override.

Cross-environment generality:

- All inputs (top, files, defines, incdirs) come from the generic
  `compile_result` shape, not from any project-specific paths.
- Include-path syntax `+incdir+<path>` (VCS) **and** `-incdir <path>`
  (xrun) are both extracted.
- UVM detection is heuristic: `-ntb_opts uvm`, `-uvm`,
  `+define+UVM*`, or any source path containing `uvm`. Any one
  signal triggers `-ntb_opts uvm` for vericom.
- Top-module selection prefers names not matching
  `uvm_custom_install*` (Synopsys recorder shims), falling back to
  the first listed top.
- `VERDI_HOME` provides tool paths; no hardcoded install prefixes.
- Cache root honours `TRACEWEAVE_CACHE_DIR`, then `XDG_CACHE_HOME`,
  then `~/.cache/traceweave/`.

`AUTO_KDB_BUILD` defaults to True. Set `TRACEWEAVE_AUTO_KDB=0` (or
`false`/`no`/`off`) to disable the snapshot suggestion. The
`build_kdb` MCP tool itself is always callable.

VCS flows are not auto-built. Recompiling with `-kdb=only` is a
one-line change to the existing compile command and reuses the VCS
license token, so the verdi_backend hint surfaces that command
verbatim instead of suggesting `build_kdb`.

## Usage Telemetry (`src/usage_telemetry.py`)

Passive, local-only instrumentation built to answer the auto-debug v2
retrospective's open question with data rather than guesses: *how often
are the shipped primitives (cursor / period / diff_first_divergence)
actually used on real workloads, and in what fraction of debug sessions?*

- `server.call_tool` is the single choke point every tool call passes
  through. It wraps `_dispatch` in a `finally` that calls
  `usage_telemetry.record_call(...)`, appending one JSONL line per call to
  `$TRACEWEAVE_CACHE_DIR/telemetry/usage.jsonl`.
- Each line records: timestamp, `session_id`, `case` (case-dir basename),
  tool name, **argument keys + a small whitelist of scalar flags** (never
  argument values or paths — noise + privacy), `ok`/`blocked`, `result_bytes`
  (a token proxy), and `latency_ms`. Failed calls additionally carry a
  classification `error_code` (a code such as `missing_prerequisite` or the
  exception class name — never the message, which can embed paths), so
  failure telemetry is analyzable without guessing from byte sizes. Long wave
  operations additionally attach a strictly whitelisted `diagnostics` block:
  wave-lock wait, fixed sweep phase, aggregate search count/total/max duration,
  discovery phase durations, and preemption-to-cancel latency. It never records
  waveform paths, scopes, search keywords, signal names, or values.
- **A session = a `get_sim_paths` case.** The get_sim_paths handler calls
  `note_session(identity)`; a new case identity mints a new `session_id`,
  re-discovering the same case keeps it. This makes "sessions in which a
  primitive was used at least once" a meaningful presence metric.
- Recording is strictly best-effort — every public function swallows its own
  exceptions so telemetry can never break a tool call.
- `aggregate(records)` is a pure function (per-tool counts, ok-rate,
  per-session distributions, tracked-feature presence) backing the offline
  `scripts/telemetry_report.py` CLI; it is deliberately NOT an MCP tool.

`TELEMETRY_ENABLED` defaults to False. Opt in with `TRACEWEAVE_TELEMETRY=1`
(or `true`/`yes`/`on`). Telemetry is local-only; nothing is sent anywhere.
